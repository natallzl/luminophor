Description: HTMLWidget implementation of PhosphorJS
    PhosphorJS provides a rich set of widgets, layouts, events, and data structures. 
    These enable developers to construct advanced, production-quality, desktop-like 
    web applications that would be otherwise impossible using CSS alone. See the
    PhosphorJS library for more information (http://phosphorjs.github.io/).
Depends: R (>= 3.4.0)
